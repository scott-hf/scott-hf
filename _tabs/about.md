A little about me...

At the age of 13, I loved Starcraft and became infatuated with the map editor and logic/scripting capabilities. I ended up spending weeks developing a "D&D" map where one player, the DM, could spawn different types of enemies at an observer. The DM could tell a story and spawn troops on the fly or make the players wait while he set up sections of the map. I've been designing and developing mods and video games ever since.

At Louisiana Tech University, every time I had a project where I had a chance to decide what to build, I chose a game. Just to list a few: FF7 Clone, RTS/Starcraft clone, side-scrolling shooter (Metal Slug), C++ Diablo-like MMORPG.

I havent quit my day job and have been working in the IT/programming world essentially all of my professional career with the exception of one year that granted me my first gray hair. In 2016, my experience with the start-up game dev studio that burned me out, and I didn't touch game dev for nearly a year afterward. 

That being said, I spend nearly all of my spare time working on gamedev mainly because I love it but also because I'd like to break free of the corporate capitalist hamster wheel and work on games full time at my own pace.

Feel free to hit me up on twitch or youtube and ask questions!
