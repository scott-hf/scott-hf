### SFX -  Soniss.com Resources

Hey there! Looking for SFX resources?? Interested in GDC soniss.com resources but don't want to download terabytes full of WAV assets?


I've got you covered. I downloaded them all and converted them to .OGG

That does mean a reduction in quality but .ogg will likely be good enough for most indie devs
